A Little About Suchaye

**Body (short):**  
Suchaye began as a small experiment at a home worktable — a place where metal, wax, scent and stories came together. Every piece is designed and finished by hand, in small batches, with an emphasis on comfort, longevity and a little bit of quiet joy. When you bring a Suchaye piece home, you’re choosing something that was made slowly, intentionally, and just for you.

## 6. About Page (`/about`)

**Heading:**  
The Story Behind Suchaye

**Body copy:**

> Suchaye is a small, homegrown studio built around the idea that the objects we live with should feel personal. It started with a single worktable, a handful of tools, and the urge to make things slowly — by hand, in small quantities, and with attention to the tiniest details.  
>  
> Every earring, pendant and candle is designed by Vibhuti and crafted in small batches. No mass production, no rush. Just honest materials, considered forms, and scents that feel familiar in the best way.  
>  
> When you choose Suchaye, you’re supporting a slower way of making: one that honours time, touch and the quiet joy of a well-made object.

You can optionally add a small “Made in [City/Region]” line at the end.
